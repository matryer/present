# Why?

^ Before we investigate why this is happening, let's look
at some terrible reasons...

---

# Terrible reasons to choose Go

* Trendy & different
* Doesn't have semicolons
* Google made it
* I <3 Go
* Opensource

(I secretly think these are all great reasons)

^ Don't use these to try and convince your boss to let you do something in Go

---

# The top reasons

* Simplicity & minimalism
* Productivity (especially `gofmt`)
* Performance
* Modern language features and excellent standard library
* Builds to a self-contained static binary

^ Simplicity: Obvious but Go codifies into the langauge
Productivity: Developers can quickly get stuff done
Performance: Even when you don't optimise code, it runs quickly
Built-in concurrency: Get the most out of a processor by using all the cores
Static binary: Again simple, binary with no other dependencies is dev ops dream

---

# Simplicity & minimalism

---

# Simplicity & minimalism

* Small language spec (only 25 keywords)[^3]
* Familiar syntax
* Only a few core features
* Easy to pick up
* Addictive philosophy

^ Tiny language.
Looks like C.
Core features: It doesn't try and solve every problem, give you primitives that you can use
like structs, interfaces, functions, vars, goroutines, channels, maps, slices, not much else
Philosophy spreads: Seek simplicity everywhere: Process, tools
...but so what? Some obvious benefits, but some surprising ones...

# Diversity

> "I think Go can be a great first language to learn due to its simplicity and minimalism. This greatly lowers the barrier for people generally excluded from server-side programming."
-- Carlisia Pinto, Founding member of GoBridge

![inline](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6oe14az5j5aizgu/carlisia.jpg?dl=1)

^ Community decided to maximize diversity (for selfish reasons)
Easy to get started helps there

---

# Accessibility

![inline](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cy16anzo5ca8t49/parhamdoustdar.jpeg?dl=1)

* Meet Parham Doustdar a Blind Go programmer from Tehran, Iran
* Uses a screen reader to read code
* "Go's simplicity means it's very easy to read or hear; that's especially important to me"

^ We glance at code to understand it, if it has to be read out
you can see why not having semi-colons is pretty attractive.

---

# Productivity

![inline](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kwcvvtmrd6x7a2a/working.jpg?dl=1)

---

# Productivity

* Getting stuff done
* Solve problems quickly
* Quickly be useful to a new team
* Join open-source projects with low friction
* Low investment: don't mind trying things or even throwing bits away

^ `gofmt` all Go code looks the same
Don't mind throwing things away because you haven't invested all this
effort up-front.

# Performance

# Performance

# Modern language features
# (and an excellent standard library)

---

# Concurrency

* Make the most of the CPU
* Easy to run code in the background:

```go
	doWork() 	// block
	go doWork() // run in background
```

* Channels for communicating and syncing

```go
	ch := make(chan string)
	ch <- "Hi there"
```

^ sync package too.
Design: Even on a single core processor (where you would get no benefit) the
code design might still improve productivity.

# `net/http` package

> "The http packages comprehensiveness has made building and running a load of http servers super easy, which given we'd picked a service oriented architecture definitely made that faster."
-- Matt Heath, Monzo

^ World class HTTP capabilities
Everything you need to build web services
