# Why?

---

# Why choose Go?

* Tiny language
* A dev team can learn the basics extremely quickly
* Designed for modern programming
* Concurrency is finally easy
* Builds to a single static binary

---

# All Go code looks the same?

`gofmt` tool provides standard formatting

* Code feels familiar
* No steep learning curve when joining new projects

---

# Is it because of how easy concurrency is?

```go
for i := 0; i < 1000000; i++ {
	go doWork(i)
}
```

* Goroutines are cheap vs expensive threads
* Built-in channel types let Goroutines communicate
* New way of thinking about software

---

# Simplicity

---

> "I think Go can be a great first language to learn due to its simplicity and minimalism. This should greatly lower the barrier for people generally excluded from server side programming."
-- Carlisia Pinto, Founding member of GoBridge

# Meet Parham Doustdar

* Blind Go programmer from Tehran, Iran
* Uses a screen reader to read code
* "Go's simplicity means it's easy to read; that's especially important to me"

A bank - written in Go. 

* "`net/http` package's comprehensiveness makes running a load of servers super easy which given we'd picked a service oriented arch definitely made that faster"[^2]
* "Static linking so we can deploy our services in scratch containers without even a shell"[^2]

# Selling Go to your boss

# Community

---

# Three challenges

---

# Challenge #1

## Introduce three new people to Go

1. Existing programmer friend 
1. Someone you work with now (maybe your boss?)
1. Younger family member who has never coded before

Show them something, tell them about it, send them a video, maybe go through [https://tour.golang.org](https://tour.golang.org) with them?

Ethan Edwards wrote a program to figure out how old he was

---

# Challenge #2

If you don't use Go at work, solve a real problem using Go in your spare time

Then show your team

---

# Challenge #3

Write a blog post showing something simple in Go and share it with your network

Tweet me @matryer for a retweet
