* Purpose of this talk

- Learn Go in 5 minutes
- Find out why Go is great for Building APIs

Goal is to convince you to build your next API in Go.

* Why Go?

- Simplicity
- Very little 'magic'
- Standard format for code
- Concurrency built in
- Testing a first class concern
- Amazing community (and Go is opensource)
- Compiles like lightning to single binary that runs anywhere
- Impressive standard library (we already have HTTP/2)

* Go philosophy

- Write code that any Gopher can read and contribute to
- Simple over clever code
- Fewer dependencies
- Don't do too much with the language
- Consider maintenance of code in the cost

Some people find Go limiting when they first look at it because we're so used to "more is better."

After time, you realise the power in its simplicity and the design decisions taken by the authors.

* Go code

.code greeter/greeter.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Using Greeter

.play greeter-demo/greeter.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Building APIs in Go

* `http` package from the standard library

Meet the `http.Handler` interface:

  type Handler interface {
    ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
  }

  http.Handle("/path", myHandler)

`http.HandlerFunc` is even easier:

  http.HandleFunc("/path", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

  })

* How http.HandlerFunc works

- HandlerFunc is a function type
- The HandlerFunc type itself implements http.Handler
- Therefore, HandlerFunc can be used wherever http.Handler is needed

  type HandlerFunc func(ResponseWriter, *Request)

  // ServeHTTP calls f(w, r).
  func (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request) {
    f(w, r)
  }

See [[https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#HandlerFunc]]

* Production ready example

.code production_ready.go

* http.ResponseWriter

  // A ResponseWriter interface is used by an HTTP handler to
  // construct an HTTP response.
  type ResponseWriter interface {

    Header() Header
    Write([]byte) (int, error)
    WriteHeader(int)

  }

from [[http://golang.org/src/net/http/server.go?s=1517:2599#L48]]

* http.Request

`http.Request` contains everything you need to know about the request.

- `r.Method` - HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` etc.)
- `r.URL.Path` - Request path (`/things/123`)
- `r.URL.String()` - Full URL
- `r.URL.Query()` - Query parameters (`q=something&p=2`)
- `r.Body` - `io.ReadCloser` of the request body

More at [[https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request]]

* Middleware

Do stuff before and after calling the handler.

  func Log(h http.Handler) http.Handler {

    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

      // before the handlers

      // call handler
      h.ServeHTTP(w, r)

      // after the handlers

    })

  }

* Middleware in code

  // Middleware wraps an http.Handler with additional
  // functionality.
  type Middleware func(http.Handler) http.Handler

  func Logging(l *log.Logger) Middleware {
    return func(h http.Handler) http.Handler {
      return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // before the handlers
        h.ServeHTTP(w, r)
        // after the handlers
      })
    }
  }

To use it:

  withLogs := Logging(l)
  http.Handle("/one", withLogs(handleOne))
  http.Handle("/two", withLogs(handleTwo))
  http.Handle("/three", withLogs(handleThree))

* Go is too cool for 30 minutes

Goroutines let you easily write multi-threaded code:

  for i := 0; i < 10000; i++ {
    go doSomething(i)
  }
  // carry on...

Channels let your goroutines communicate:

  itemChan := make(chan Item)

  for {
    select {
    case item := <-itemChan:
      doSomething(item)
    case err := <-errChan:
      handleError(err)
    case <-time.After(1 * time.Minute):
      log.Println("nothing happened for 1 minute")
    }
  }

* infoShare workshop report

- This morning we built a complete API, and hosted it on Google App Engine
- 3.5 hours workshop
- Zero code was written before the workshop

See what we built: [[https://github.com/matryer/infoshare]]

* Community

Go has one of the most inclusive and patient communities in tech.
